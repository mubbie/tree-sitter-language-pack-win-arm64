## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0-rc.1] - 2026-03-09

Complete rewrite from Python to Rust with polyglot language bindings.

### Added

- Rust core library (`ts-pack-core`) with `LanguageRegistry` for thread-safe grammar access
- C-FFI layer (`ts-pack-ffi`) with cbindgen-generated headers and panic shields
- Python bindings via PyO3/maturin (`ts-pack-python`) with PyCapsule support
- Node.js bindings via NAPI-RS (`ts-pack-node`) with TypeScript definitions
- Go bindings via cgo (`ts-pack-go`) with platform-specific build directives
- Java bindings via Panama FFM (`ts-pack-java`) targeting JDK 22+
- Elixir bindings via Rustler NIF (`ts-pack-elixir`) with ExUnit tests
- CLI tool (`ts-pack-cli`) for grammar management (init, list, add, remove, info, build)
- E2E test generator with 7 language backends (Rust, Python, TypeScript, Go, Java, Elixir, C)
- 21 test fixtures across 4 categories (smoke, parsing, error handling, registry)
- Dynamic linking mode (`TSLP_LINK_MODE=dynamic`) for per-parser shared libraries
- Feature-gated language selection via `TSLP_LANGUAGES` env var or Cargo features
- Language group features: `web`, `systems`, `scripting`, `data`, `jvm`, `functional`
- Tree-sitter 0.26 support with `Language::into_raw()` / `Language::from_raw()`
- Domain-split CI workflows (ci-validate, ci-rust, ci-python, ci-node, ci-go, ci-java, ci-elixir, ci-c)
- Multi-registry publish workflow (crates.io, PyPI, npm, GitHub Releases for Go FFI)
- 168 language grammars supported

### Changed

- Architecture: Python-only package → Rust core with polyglot bindings
- Parser compilation: pure Python with tree-sitter CLI → Rust `build.rs` with `cc` crate
- Language registry: dictionary-based → typed `LanguageRegistry` with thread-safe `LazyLock` access
- Error handling: Python exceptions → Rust `Result<T, E>` with cross-language error conversion
- Repository moved from `Goldziher/tree-sitter-language-pack` to `kreuzberg-dev/tree-sitter-language-pack`
- Node.js package renamed to `@kreuzberg/tree-sitter-language-pack`
- Java groupId changed from `io.github.tree-sitter` to `dev.kreuzberg`
- Go module path updated to `github.com/kreuzberg-dev/tree-sitter-language-pack/go`
- README branding updated with kreuzberg.dev banner and Discord community link

### Removed

- Python-only implementation (setup.py, MANIFEST.in, tree_sitter_language_pack/)
- Direct tree-sitter Python dependency for parsing (now via native bindings)
- Cython-based build pipeline
